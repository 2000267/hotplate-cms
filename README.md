# hotplate-cms

This project is in early development. The idea is to build a tool that is usable for people who want to use Firebase as a way to host normal websites. This project is also for people who don't feel like paying the people at Flamelink (sorry Flamelink, but there's always room for competition!).

Again, since this is an early project, you are left with only these instructions:

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
